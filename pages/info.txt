to run everyday:
one pagination.py->should create 1 csv files: raw
two clean data.py->should create 1 csv files: clean data
should run from models folder: fb_create_models.py and lstm_create_models.py

-todo: should find some anomaly detection algorithms/more multivariate algorithms

Covariates Series
Until now, we have only been playing with models that only use the history of the target series to predict its future. However, as explained above, the global Darts models also support the use of covariates time series. These are time series of “external data”, which we are not necessarily interested in predicting, but which we would still like to feed as input of our models because they can contain valuable information.
